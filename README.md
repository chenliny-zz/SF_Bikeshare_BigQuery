# BigQuery Playground - San Francisco Bikeshare
**For better viewing experience, please see project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chenliny/SF_Bikeshare_BigQuery/blob/master/SF_Bikeshare_BigQuery.ipynb)**

This playground project consists of two parts. In part I, I had a Q&A session with the historic San Francisco bikeshare data hosted on Google's BigQuery Public Datasets using BigQuery SQL. In part II, I created a proof-of-concept ML model using BigQuery ML in BigQuery using pure SQL.
