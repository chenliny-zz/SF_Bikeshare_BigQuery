This playground project consists of two parts. In the first part, I had a Q&A session with the historic San Francisco bikeshare data hosted on Google's BigQuery Public Datasets using BigQuery SQL. In the second part, I followed the BigQuery ML documentation and created a simple machine learning model in BigQuery using pure SQL. More recent or real-time San Francisco bikeshare data (now rebranded as Lyft Bay Wheels) can be found here. Since this project's main focus is on BigQuery and BigQuery ML, that dataset was not used.
